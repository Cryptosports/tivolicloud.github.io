Welcome to the Tivoli Cloud VR <em>weekly update</em> for August 10, 2020!</p><p>It&apos;s been an exciting week here at Tivoli Cloud VR, with some major changes to both our organization and to our platform. &#xA0;</p><p><strong><u>Transitioning to a B-Corp</u></strong></p><p>In fall of 2019, we started Tivoli Cloud VR following the usual Silicon Valley startup recipe, opening the door as a type-C from Delaware with a plan to raise VC funding with an eventual exit strategy 5-10 years down the road. The typical Silicon Valley type-C corporation is focused primarily on generating a big payout for its investors and shareholders. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/08/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Becoming a B-corp, transparent web entities, Meward, parties at the Nut, and more..." loading="lazy" width="1000" height="500" srcset="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image.png 600w, https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/08/image.png 1000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>After some serious thought into our motivations, we realized it wasn&apos;t really representative of our ideals nor the direction we wanted to go. We have never been in this for the money, nor have we ever seriously entertained the idea that social VR would be a profitable enterprise. Instead, we are driven by the fun, the magic and delight, the boundless human connectivity and positive social impact of multiuser, shared virtual reality. &#xA0;To that end, we&apos;ve dropped our shareholder-focused model and formally changed Tivoli to a<em> Public Benefit Corporation</em>, down to the very core of our articles of incorporation, which now read:</p><p><em>..for the specific public benefit of creating positive social impact by leveraging VR technologies. This shall include (i) promoting open-source VR as a public resource (ii) enriching the lives of individuals through an open metaverse, (iii) advocating for privacy, security, well-being and socially positive conduct in VR.</em> </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/08/image-23.png" class="kg-image" alt="Becoming a B-corp, transparent web entities, Meward, parties at the Nut, and more..." loading="lazy" width="1255" height="760" srcset="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-23.png 600w, https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/08/image-23.png 1000w, https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/08/image-23.png 1255w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>With our new building logs, you too can become a full-stack developer!</figcaption></figure><p>Changing to a<em> B-Corp</em> means putting people and purpose over profits (quadruple P, right there!), with annual public benefit reporting, financial transparency, and broadening the scope of our actions and services to address our newly refocused mission. In addition to our continuing our own open-source platform, we&apos;ll be offering free services to other open-source forks of the <em>HFVRP</em>. Formalizing and incorporating our true motivations into the legal fabric of our entity provide a wonderful sense of relief that Tivoli Cloud VR will remain focused on what is truly meaningful to us. In addition to the transition to a legal <em>Public Benefit Corporation</em>, we will be working with the non-profit<em> B-Organization</em>, to become fully certified and compliant with all the accountability that comes with running a <em>B-corp.</em></p><p>Our success will not be measured in dollars or the price of shareholders&apos; stocks, but instead the positive and meaningful social change we create.</p><p><strong>Fun Stuff</strong></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/08/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Becoming a B-corp, transparent web entities, Meward, parties at the Nut, and more..." loading="lazy" width="933" height="677" srcset="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/08/image-1.png 600w, https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/08/image-1.png 933w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Playing Frog Fractions on the media screen at the Squirrel Nut</figcaption></figure><p>Some fun new content has been added recently!

To that end, we&apos;ve released an early-access Blender add-on which we think will make world building an easier and more delightful experience! </p><h2 id="tivoli-tools-for-blender-add-on">Tivoli Tools for Blender add-on</h2><p><a href="https://blender.org">Blender </a>is a remarkable piece of open-source software, which has become to tool of choice for 3D artists worldwide. With the release of Blender 2.8, significant improvements to the platform, its shading pipeline, and remarkable GLTF export implementation have made it extremely well-suited for use in virtual reality and game development. Imagine if you could do all your world-building inside Blender, bringing individual models as Tivoli entities, all in place. As an example, let&apos;s take a look at the <a href="https://tivoli.link/3PDxKZf3FYQdlBquJGMZVR">Squirrel Nut Cafe</a>:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/07/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="Blender tools are here!" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The Squirrel Nut Cafe was built out in Blender using Collection Instances to create duplicate entities.</figcaption></figure><p>If you visit the Nut, you&apos;ll notice that most models in the world are actual entities, with which you can inspect, pick up, clone, and interact. Unlike a single model, where everything is nailed down, the cafe is a living space. You can pick the flowers and bring them to your table, or grab a cup and a slice of cake. It would be difficult to build such a scene in the standard in-world create tools, but with the Tivoli Tools for Blender add-on, you can easily position and edit your models the Blender way. If you are placing duplicate objects, like a plate on every table or 20 coffee mugs stacked up on a cupboard shelf, you can use collection instances, which Tivoli will interpret as a prefab entity, and intelligently re-use the same model file. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/07/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="Blender tools are here!" loading="lazy"><figcaption>The coffee cup collection instances from Blender become prefab-style entities in Tivoli.</figcaption></figure><p>Once you have your scene built out, just press the <em>Export Scene to JSON</em> button, and the add-on will export the individual models, optionally convert the textures to .webp, and a JSON file. Pop it up on <a href="https://docs.tivolicloud.com/worlds/uploading-assets/">Tivoli Files</a> or your web server, import the URL to the JSON file, and your complete world comes into Tivoli, with models and collection instances as individual entities. Using the Tivoli Tools for Blender add-on, we were able to build this rich and complex scene, which would have otherwise been prohibitively complicated to build. There&apos;s also an experimental light mapper in there, but we underscore the experimental aspect&#x2013; being early access, there may be issues!</p><p>We&apos;re excited to see the great things people will build with the add-on! For more information, you can learn how to use the add-on in our <a href="https://docs.tivolicloud.com/worlds/blender-tools/">documentation</a>.</p><p>Thanks for reading our blog&#x2013; we hope to see you in world! &#xA0;And if you haven&apos;t already, please do <a href="https://discord.gg/FhuzTwR">join our Discord</a>!</p><p></p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.tivolicloud.com/worlds/blender-tools/">Docs: Tivoli Tools for Blender add-on</a></p><p><a href="https://docs.tivolicloud.com/worlds/blender-tools/">Docs: Uploading assets to Tiivoli Files</a></p><p><a href="https://tivoli.link/3PDxKZf3FYQdlBquJGMZVR">World: Squirrel Nut Cafe:</a></p><p><a href="https://tivolicloud.github.io/early-access-somenew-tools/Blender.org">Blender.org</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Early Access Excess]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h3 id="join-us-to-celebrate-our-early-access-release-with-an-epic-party-on-saturday-july-11th-2-6pm-pacific-time-">Join us to celebrate our Early Access Release with an epic party on Saturday, July 11th, 2-6pm Pacific Time!</h3><p></p><p>We are overjoyed to welcome so many new and friendly faces on <strong><a href="https://tivolicloud.com/">Tivoli Cloud VR</a></strong>, and we want to top our delight about our <strong><a href="https://tivolicloud.github.io/tivoli-cloud-vr-opens-early-access/">Early Access Release</a></strong> with a wild party.</p>]]></description><link>https://tivolicloud.github.io/early-access-excess/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5f055301eab6a6000191ff53</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[XaosPrincess]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jul 2020 18:22:19 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/07/EarlyAccessExcess-1.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3 id="join-us-to-celebrate-our-early-access-release-with-an-epic-party-on-saturday-july-11th-2-6pm-pacific-time-">Join us to celebrate our Early Access Release with an epic party on Saturday, July 11th, 2-6pm Pacific Time!</h3><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/07/EarlyAccessExcess-1.png" alt="Early Access Excess"><p></p><p>We are overjoyed to welcome so many new and friendly faces on <strong><a href="https://tivolicloud.com/">Tivoli Cloud VR</a></strong>, and we want to top our delight about our <strong><a href="https://tivolicloud.github.io/tivoli-cloud-vr-opens-early-access/">Early Access Release</a></strong> with a wild party.</p><p>In addition to having a wonderful time with like minded folks in social VR our party also offers the opportunity to experience Tivoli Cloud VR&apos;s unique gathering features - for one thing its ability to hosts crowds of up to 500 avatars in one non-instanced space, and for another thing its state of the art spatial audio whose optional attenuation zones we have designed to facilitate blasting sound on the dancefloor while still enabling more intimate conversations in the quieter areas around it.</p><p>With <strong><a href="https://kreolis.net/">Kreolis </a></strong>on the decks and <strong>Brainstormer </strong>as master of light and particles we have everything set up for a fantastic time, still - like it is the case with virtual worlds as well - what makes a party truly shine are its guests.</p><p>Therefore we would like to cordially invite all of you to our <strong><a href="https://tivoli.link/6y2z79AZUFn3bsHeOFe9Tu">Early Access Excess</a></strong> on <strong>Saturday, July 11th, 2-6pm Pacific Time</strong>.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/07/tivoli-snap-by-XaosPrincess-on-2020-07-07_05-21-46.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Early Access Excess" loading="lazy"></figure><h3 id="onboarding-instructions">Onboarding Instructions</h3><ol><li>Visit our website: <a href="https://tivolicloud.com/">https://tivolicloud.com/</a>.</li><li>Click on &quot;Sign In&quot; to create a Tivoli Cloud VR account.</li><li>Click on &quot;Download&quot; to get the installer for your OS.</li><li>Run the installer and click on &quot;run anyway&quot; if your OS&apos;s &#xA0;defense system flags Tivoli.</li><li>With the launcher installed - open this address in your internet browser: <a href="https://tivoli.link/6y2z79AZUFn3bsHeOFe9Tu">https://tivoli.link/6y2z79AZUFn3bsHeOFe9Tu</a> and click on &quot;Launch Tivoli to world&quot;.

The only limit is your imagination!</strong> </strong></p><p>Hello and a warm welcome from the Tivoli Cloud VR team! </p><p>Although we come from a range of different cultural backgrounds - USA, Belgium, Germany - we are united by one dream: living and working in cyberspace. </p><p>Inspired by its depictions in Neil Stephenson&#x2019;s <em>Snow Crash</em> or William Gibson&#x2019;s <em>Neuromancer</em>, the idea of a metaverse that connects people from all over the world in a fantastic virtual space has always fascinated us, even when consumer virtual reality was nothing more than a wild science fiction dream back in the last century&#x2019;s 80&#x2019;s. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/07/hifi-snap-by-XaosPrincess-on-2019-02-05_02-40-48.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Tivoli Cloud VR opens Early Access" loading="lazy"><figcaption>80&apos;s spirit in our Tank&apos;s Corner Bar</figcaption></figure><p>Now that Moore&#x2019;s law has summed up to our favor, making virtual reality accessible for everyone, we intend to build exactly this imaginative universe we have dreamed of all our lives: A connected place in which only one&#x2019;s own imagination is the limit to reinvent oneself in any form, age, gender or species, and in which everybody can build a world of their dreams to live and work in. </p><p>While building tools for this, e.g. Unity or Unreal Engine, had been there for a longer period of time, our eagerness to connect our physical world in a virtual universe was facing the challenge of the above mentioned engines not being able to hold more than 30-50 users at the same time in the same space. In our eyes a virtual world can only qualify as a parallel reality if it offers the same amenities our real world does which - among others - is to let people gather in crowds to enjoy the presence of each other as well as to find present and future friends in gatherings. </p><p>The only innovator building on the idea of a non-instanced cyberspace was Philip Rosedale, who designed a VR engine from scratch that is able to retain more than 500 avatars in one non-instanced space. When Philip&apos;s company High Fidelity folded its virtual worlds operations in January 2020, we embraced the potential of this innovative open-source architecture and sought to continue the project while extending its functionality and ease of use. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/07/hifi-snap-by-XaosPrincess-on-2019-12-03_01-50-25.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Tivoli Cloud VR opens Early Access" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Thank you, Philip!</figcaption></figure><p>For half a year now our CEO Caitlyn Meeks and our CTO Maki Deprez have been working on a volcanic island (<a href="https://tivolicloud.github.io/tivoli-intro/">https://tivolicloud.github.io/tivoli-intro/</a>) to build the virtual universe of our dreams. </p><p>Maki has implemented a new metaverse API which makes it easy and accessible for everybody to connect to their friends and their favorite worlds, as well as a cloud storage system superseding the need to host one&#x2019;s own server according to our distributed software architecture. Furthermore she has smoothened our engine&#x2019;s overall performance making it possible to access our metaverse from even lower end computers. Also Maki has made the in-world building tools more accessible and is currently working on a streamlined Blender 2.8 integration. And - neither last nor least - we offer a comprehensive Javascript API that allows everything imaginable to be fully scripted - from the simplest elevator to highly sophisticated in-world games. </p><p>Since our goal has always been to make Tivoli Cloud VR user-friendly and accessible to everyone - from the seasoned coder to the VR first-timer without a tech background - we originally intended to directly start with a full consumer release in Q3 2020. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/07/XaosLockdownDanceParty.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Tivoli Cloud VR opens Early Access" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Lockdown Dance Party sponsored by Tivoli Cloud VR</figcaption></figure><p>However, our experience of the last four months, overshadowed by a worldwide pandemic and lockdown, has changed our minds: While this time has been the hardest we&apos;ve experienced in terms of real life relationships, the lockdown&#x2019;s silver lining has brought the blessing of social VR, enabling to feel each other&#x2019;s presence - even if one is across the world - to the minds of the general public. Whereas - four month ago - we were still afraid of the &#x201C;VR winter&#x201D;, now people can&#x2019;t get enough of social VR, as this is the only place which facilitates human connections without the need to interact physically. But - disregarding which virtual worlds they visited to embrace this feeling of human connections - all new social VR users were sooner or later running into the problem of mandatory instances that made it impossible to easily find each other, let alone to meet up in a crowd. Especially this last mentioned psychological effect that speaks to the herd instinct of the human mind will not be possible for at least another year - until we have a Covid-19 vaccination - in real life. </p><p>In order to cater to this universal need of gathering in a crowd in a beautiful place, we have decided to prepone our release and make Tivoli Cloud VR accessible for everyone in its early access version. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/07/hifi-snap-by-XaosPrincess-on-2018-12-31_04-24-34.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Tivoli Cloud VR opens Early Access" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A connected place allowing everybody to reinvent themselves in any form, age, gender or species</figcaption></figure><p>As of today we invite you all to create an account on <a href="https://tivolicloud.com/">https://tivolicloud.com/</a> in order to <a href="https://docs.tivolicloud.com/">explore </a>and inhabit our dream of a friendly, creative and inclusive metaverse! </p><p>If you&#x2019;re technically skilled - you can already <a href="https://docs.tivolicloud.com/worlds/host-a-world-advanced">host your own server</a> and start to build your own world, and for newer social VR users we offer a range of events and classes as well as our sandbox domain <strong><a href="https://tivoli.link/4Rmh9EEI1gQ8ArVMYQd9o8">Creator Crossing</a></strong> to get your own creations in-world or build new ones from scratch using our Create Tools or more casual applications like Fingerpaint or Voxelpaint. </p><p>While we are happy to provide B2B clients with a custom server, we are working full speed on automating our cloud hosting service to enable new users to set up their own virtual worlds by the click of a button. In addition to being able to immediately create worlds using their own servers, we also invite our code-savvy users to contribute to <a href="https://git.tivolicloud.com/">our open source repository</a> - be it for improving our codebase in general, or for implementing desired core features themselves.

Little did I know, just how much would change and evolve a couple of years into the new millennium. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/03/UpsideDown-3.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Hello from Tivoli Cloud VR&apos;s CMO &amp; Events Manager" loading="lazy"><figcaption>VR has turned my life upside down</figcaption></figure><p>The first and most wonderful turnaround in my life were the births of my two children in the early tens. Still this personal luck came at a social and professional price, as I didn&#x2019;t want to leave my kids at home to attend social gatherings or pursue my movie career. </p><p>The second and most mind blowing turning point in my life was the arrival of virtual reality for consumers. With my pre-ordered HTC Vive I spent half a year in Elite Dangerous which - I&#x2019;m sure - contributed a lot to me never experiencing motion sickness at all. </p><p>On the search for more content to experience in virtual reality I discovered Philip Rosedale&#x2019;s multiuser platform High Fidelity, and I immediately knew that social VR was the place where I wanted to spend most of my social and professional life in. </p><p>Alas High Fidelity often seemed too vast and complicated for new users, and just when I was about to found a social VR events company, the platform pivoted, and I had to look for a new grid to base my endeavors on. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/03/BurningMan.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Hello from Tivoli Cloud VR&apos;s CMO &amp; Events Manager" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Burning Man in VR</figcaption></figure><p>I explored all kinds of virtual worlds, and while I adored most of them for their creative and commercial capabilities, none of them was able to provide what to me makes for the true magic of social VR: The heartwarming feeling of being connected with friends from all over the world in an experience so natural that one forgets about all the heavy gear one has to wear to make it possible. </p><p>While High Fidelity pulled this off very well, most other platforms I visited fell short in regards of crowd hosting and naturalistic 3D audio. After experiencing this personal deal breaker time and time again, I felt lost and was almost about to give up on social VR for the time being, until I learned that Tivoli Cloud VR is picking up on exactly these ideas. </p><p>With a welcoming and accessible user experience, a special focus on hosting hundreds of avatars in one non-instanced space, as well as crystal clear spatial audio that enables me to locate my friends even with closed eyes, Tivoli Cloud VR is in my eyes the one and only platform that has the potential to let the metaverse thrive. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/03/TivoliTeam.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Hello from Tivoli Cloud VR&apos;s CMO &amp; Events Manager" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Tivoli Cloud VR Team Party</figcaption></figure><p>Which gets me to the third most heart warming turning point in my life: I&#x2019;m over the moon that CEO Caitlyn Meeks and CTO Maki Deprez have invited me to join the Tivoli Cloud VR team as Chief Marketing Officer and Events Manager!</p><p>Not only is this giving me the possibility to make my dream of living and working in cyberspace come true on a technological basis, but to me it also lays the ground for realizing a social utopia: As an all women-led team we have the chance to shape a virtual world free of discrimination and social injustice. </p><p>While all of us love men and see them as equal partners, each of us has experienced unfairness in the patriarchalism that&apos;s still - more or less covertly - encrypted into many organizational structures of companies led by men. </p><p>With Tivoli Cloud VR we want to make a change - not only in terms of gender equality, but also with high regard to inclusivity of all kinds of traits one cannot choose by oneself - like ethnical origin or sexual orientation, physical or mental health, as well as age or the ability to afford higher education. &#xA0;</p><p>In terms of practical purposes I&#x2019;m looking forward to do in Tivoli Cloud VR what I love most - bringing people together in social VR by producing captivating events and facilitating a wide range of use cases for a multitude of users. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/07/LPDII-4.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Hello from Tivoli Cloud VR&apos;s CMO &amp; Events Manager" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Lockdown Dance Party sponsored by Tivoli Cloud VR&#xA0;</figcaption></figure><p>And right now I&#x2019;m stoked to shout out what to me - and hopefully to the rest of the world - will be a turning point for social VR: </p><p><strong><a href="https://tivolicloud.github.io/tivoli-cloud-vr-opens-early-access/">Tivoli Cloud VR&apos;s Early Access Release</a> <em> </em></strong><br>From now on everybody can make an account and explore our worlds on <a href="https://tivolicloud.com/">https://tivolicloud.com/</a>, and we would be overjoyed to welcome many new and friendly avatar faces at our weekly <strong>Tivoli Tea Time</strong> meetings, starting this Saturday, July 4th, at 1pm Pacific Time in our beautiful <strong><a href="https://tivoli.link/3PDxKZf3FYQdlBquJGMZVR">Squirrel Nut Cafe</a></strong>. </p><p>And - of course - we will also have an epic <strong><a href="https://tivolicloud.github.io/early-access-excess/">Early Access Party</a></strong> which will take place on Saturday, July 11th, 2-6pm Pacific Time in our newly decorated <strong><a href="https://tivoli.link/6y2z79AZUFn3bsHeOFe9Tu">club</a></strong>. </p><p>Stay tuned for more info here or on our <a href="https://discord.com/invite/FhuzTwR"><strong>Discord</strong></a>. <br> <br>I can&#x2019;t wait to meet you all in virtual person!

This online presence goes beyond clicking a <em>Like </em>button on Facebook or chatting together on Discord or Slack. With Tivoli Cloud VR, you can summon up an office for meetings. You can create interactive training spaces, experiences and simulations. You can hang out with your friends and watch 3D movies, visit a museum, or have your own personal garden of delights, with affordable VR hardware you can pick up at any electronics store.</p><p>Here&apos;s some of the new technologies we&apos;re working on to make Tivoli Cloud VR the most delightful, extensible and easy to use multiuser VR platform.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><video controls style="width: 100%" poster="https://cdn.tivolicloud.com/videos/speech-recognition-prototype.png">

Special thanks to Google Cloud Platform for making their machine-learning based speech platform available to us.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/02/image-5.png" class="kg-image" alt="What&apos;s new at Tivoli Cloud" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Tivoli Cloud with Vive Pro Eye tracking reproduces your eye and eyelid movement in VR</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Eye Tracking &#xA0;</strong><br>We communicate not only with our voices, but with our body language and, importantly, our eyes. Commonly called the windows to the soul, eyes can reveal a subtle unspoken range of feelings, from anger to shyness to distraction to impatience, even romantic interest. A quick roll of the eyes can speak volumes, or looking off to the side can indicate discomfort. Eyelids can convey sleepiness, suspicion, surprise, boredom. Eye to eye contact is essential to communicate interest, in certain cultures, and an indicator of disrespect or aggression in others. Multi-user VR without eye language is missing a critical dimension, and that&#x2019;s why this is so important for us to implement. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LMlN7E3-Bg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>That&#x2019;s why eye tracking is now fully supported in Tivoli Cloud VR. If you&#x2019;re lucky enough to be using a VR headset like the HTC Vive Pro Eye, your eye movements are captured and sent over the wire to other people in VR with you. The subtle communication of your eyes is captured by your virtual reality headset, and faithfully reproduced on your avatar to the people around you. This provides an incredible amount of human feeling and a level of communication that&#x2019;s unprecedented in other multi-user virtual reality platforms. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/02/entity-priority-screenshot.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="What&apos;s new at Tivoli Cloud" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Tivoli&apos;s new Entity Priority system gives you control over which entities get your CPU&apos;s attention.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Entity Priority System</strong><br>We&#x2019;ve implemented a new technology we call Entity Prioritization, with which world-builders can designate the amount of computing attention is dedicated to different things running in your simulated world. Previously, everything in your world was set up to receive and transmit, at varying times, updates from the system of their states. Although the <em>HFVRP </em>attempts to prioritize update attention intelligently, it is constantly checking everything around it, which wastes unneeded resources if you have entities that you simply want to designate as static or scenery. When polling the world around your avatar, the Entity Prioritization System automatically can identify and skip static-designated entities, which saves a ton of computing resources on the CPU, which in turn makes everything feel buttery smooth. And on the other extreme, you can also designate any entity you wish as Prioritized, indicating that it deserves extra CPU resources, for example a critical element in a game or world where it is imperative to function smoothly and quickly as possible. &#xA0; </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2020/02/zone-culling.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="What&apos;s new at Tivoli Cloud" loading="lazy"></figure><p><strong>Zone Culling</strong><br>One feature we&apos;ve recently implemented which has been requested by our users is <em>Zone Culling</em>, which intelligently disregards all entities that are outside a specified zone. If you step into a cafe with zone culling turned on, everything outside of the cafe is ignored on both the CPU and GPU, yielding a considerable performance increase. &#xA0;<br><br><strong>A brand new, fully scalable Metaverse back-end </strong><br>The Tivoli metaverse is a sophisticated server system which acts like the glue that binds a universe of users and virtual worlds connected together. When you or your friends hop from place to place to place, form personal connections, when a world goes on or offline, or when files are served to and from worlds and avatars, this activity takes place on a network of servers unseen to the general public. Considering how critical such a system is to the long-term success of a multiuser virtual reality system, we have been working hard at developing a proprietary server stack to do exactly this. Consequently, we&apos;ve built a rock-solid, scalable architecture with built-in load-balancing and elasticity. The Tivoli metaverse back-end can automatically distribute itself across multiple containerized instances in different data centers around the world! </p><p>Thanks for reading! &#xA0;We can&apos;t wait to see you soon in VR.</p><p>Caitlyn &amp; Maki<br><br></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Our natural approach to social VR]]></title><description><![CDATA[We've been hard at work on the technical side, but thinking a lot about design philosophy too, figuring out what will make people want to use Tivoli Cloud VR and keep coming back.

We want to create an easy-to-use, scalable, and delightful social VR service that people really enjoy using. We want the people who use it to feel terrifically empowered by the limitless possibilities of VR, while at the same time feeling extremely cozy and at home. We&apos;ve been hard at work on the technical challenges of social VR, but thinking a lot about design philosophy too, figuring out what will make people want to use Tivoli Cloud VR and keep coming back. We&apos;ve come to realize there&apos;s a lot in common here with urban planning and the phenomenon of <em>desire paths. </em>Desire paths are the shortcuts and dirt paths that diverge off the planned map. It&apos;s urban planning democracy where you vote with your feet.</p><p>Creating a truly scalable, multi-user spatial computing architecture is a complex computer engineering kind of problem. But making it into an experience that is delightful, empowering, and cozy? That&apos;s a<em> listening-and-paying-attention-to-people</em> kind of problem. People interact with reality in a way which can&#x2019;t be understood with flow-charts, but can be understood through empathetic engagement: listening, watching, and making the design decisions that respond to the needs of the actual people who use it. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/C8Ni8NzU3eVNI2yKaGVcrvGtWQo7GAwm9Old9Eg2Hkn_bqm0hjnlJeQbup-F6vz_5Qzv29wRbd0C2orZlPIt42dsZGU9CeVGrFT_vJhgh8hRGB-bAJBGH26dVTtKrtWd1oecOEd4" class="kg-image" alt="Our natural approach to social VR" loading="lazy"><figcaption>London&#x2019;s Thamesmead Housing Estate is master-planned, cold and lifeless.</figcaption></figure><p>Design without empathy creates experiences that are mediocre, lifeless and sometimes oppressive.

In <em>A Pattern Language</em>, &#xA0;architect Christopher Alexander writes <em>&#x201C;..most of the beautiful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people</em>. &#xA0;&#x201C;</p><p>Tivoli Cloud VR is made by people who they themselves want to co-exist in a delightful and powerful virtual world.

We&apos;re building a spatialized metaverse from a volcanic island"><p>Unlike a super villain&apos;s volcanic island lair from a James Bond film, ours doesn&apos;t include an atomic doomsday laser, but does have shirtless German tourists and open air restaurants. It is from here, the volcanic island of Tenerife, that we started engineering a spatialized metaverse architecture.</p><p>By <em>we</em>, I mean Caitlyn Meeks, former chief evangelist at High Fidelity (that&apos;s me), and my partner, our CTO and co-founder, Maki Deprez, an accomplished programmer and VR content creator. Together, we&apos;re building a spatialized metaverse on the architectural foundations first laid by the open-source virtual reality company, High Fidelity. We believe this architecture, and its future progeny, <em>will</em> become the foundation of the spatial networking metaverse we&apos;ve all been waiting for.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2019/11/puppets-at-epic-1-.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Hello! We&apos;re building a spatialized metaverse from a volcanic island" loading="lazy"><figcaption>We&apos;re fairies</figcaption></figure><p>In this and future blog posts, we&apos;ll explain why we believe this is the way to go. We&apos;ll talk about the features and functionality we&apos;re adding and changing in our distribution. &#xA0;And we&apos;ll discuss our philosophical differences on important matters like user experience, product design, community support, and commerce. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2019/11/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="Hello! We&apos;re building a spatialized metaverse from a volcanic island" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Anyone remember this? Unity + the Oculus DK1 heralded the inevitability of consumer VR.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="game-engines-weren-t-made-for-this-"><strong>Game engines weren&apos;t made for this.</strong></h2><p>I remember the day we got an Oculus DK1. &#xA0;I worked at Unity then, and experiments with the headset and Hydra hand controllers promised a glimpse of a coming first wave of consumer VR. Later on, ExitGames&apos; Photon Cloud multiuser networking SDK appeared in our Asset Store submission queue. It was clear how easily someone could snap these together to make a multiuser VR chat app. &#xA0;It wasn&apos;t long before they started to surface, notables including AltSpace, Rec Room and VRChat. &#xA0;With a Unity based client and Photon running the back-end, there wasn&apos;t a lot of heavy engineering to do, giving indie developers an opportunity to experiment and have fun. The fun and novelty of social VR attracted users, drove entirely new kinds of live events, and fostered vibrant meme-based subcultures in spite of numerous technical constraints. &#xA0;Alas, once the platforms grew in concurrent users, however, these constraints became a real problem and the novelty began to wear off. &#xA0;</p><p>When you want a reasonable group of people in the same room at the same time, the joists under the floor start to creak. &#xA0;The experience degrades. The network bogs down. &#xA0;Lag sets in. Your frame rate drops. Streamed audio is crudely attenuated. People talk on top of each other. User generated content crashes the client. Features made to help game developers turn into exploits for malicious users. </p><p>Game engines weren&apos;t designed to create an elegant spatialized metaverse.</p><h2 id="not-ready-player-one">Not-ready Player One</h2><p>I spotted <em>Ready Player One</em> at a bookstore in 2012. I was impressed by level of detail depicted in Kline&apos;s fictional <em>The Oasis</em> metaverse, and considered the architecture of such a system. It&apos;d need to handle petabytes of network packets routed and rerouted between hundreds of thousands of servers, millions of clients. And it would need client software designed to shape it into a nuanced dance of human interaction.</p><p>This requires a new kind of thinking. &#xA0;This is a computer science problem, not a game development problem.</p><h2 id="building-a-true-spatial-metaverse-architecture">Building a true spatial metaverse architecture</h2><p>When I caught word that Philip Rosedale&apos;s new company, <em>High Fidelity</em>, was working on cracking the metaverse architecture problem, I left an edifying career of seven years at Unity and joined the company. &#xA0;First thing that struck me when visiting the office was spotting &quot;<em>You can&apos;t just copy code from Stack Overflow&quot;</em> penned on the stairwell wall. &#xA0;The High Fidelity team was an extremely sharp group of engineers, many were former senior developers behind the popular virtual world, Second Life, and computer scientists who wrote the first media streaming codecs at Real Networks.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2019/11/high-fidelity.gif" class="kg-image" alt="Hello! We&apos;re building a spatialized metaverse from a volcanic island" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Here I am with colleague Ryan Downe-Karpf demonstrating our early prototype</figcaption></figure><p>&quot;<em>We&apos;re throwing the full Hail Mary</em>&quot; to create the metaverse, one of my coworkers once put it. Engineers covered whiteboards with plans for an avatar-mediated metaverse architecture: a custom client built from scratch to stream, process and render avatar, audio and entity data as quickly and efficiently as possible. A server stack with discrete components for processing simultaneous streams of avatar skeletal information, entity operations, spatialized 3D audio streams, manage authoritative physics, script execution and inter-domain messaging. And notably, the design called for decentralized servers that could run on anybody&apos;s hardware, while communicating together via a central DNS grid server. Audio was of utmost importance, and R&amp;D created what is arguably the best sounding, most nuanced, and lowest latency 3D spatialized voice streaming system ever made. &#xA0;</p><p>This research culminated in software capable of handling several hundreds of avatars in a single instance of space simultaneously, while delivering low latency, nuanced and spatially attenuated audio, conveying subtle body language from just headset and hand controller data. &#xA0; We hosted load test events on high powered, 96-core servers with well over 450 actual human operated avatars interacting together <u><em>in the same virtual space</em></u>. &#xA0;Not cheating with multiple server shards, but in the same discrete space, together, while logging and monitoring the massive streams of data to further optimize and improve the platform. &#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2019/11/overview.png" class="kg-image" alt="Hello! We&apos;re building a spatialized metaverse from a volcanic island" loading="lazy"><figcaption>High Fidelity&apos;s metaverse architecture was an important technical accomplishment.</figcaption></figure><p>Spring 2019 was a tough season for High Fidelity, when business circumstance pivoted the company away from the metaverse and production shifted towards a seemingly more commercially viable remote coworking product. The company&apos;s virtual world servers were abruptly taken offline. &#xA0;The metaverse project largely dropped off the radar. There&apos;s a lot of theories about why the company decided to sunset its metaverse project, and I&apos;ll not go into them here. &#xA0;What&apos;s important is that the company made core parts of the architecture open-source so it could survive exactly this kind of situation. </p><p>The Xerox Alto, first created in 1973, introduced the point and click desktop interface used everywhere today. It never went to market. Today, this interaction model is at the heart of every Macintosh and Windows computer. Similarly, we feel that the spatial computing architecture engineered at High Fidelity, and its progeny, will become the backbone of spatial computing for decades to come. </p><h2 id="on-surviving-vr-winter">On surviving VR Winter</h2><p>VR Winter is probably coming, but like the title says, we&apos;ve been literally working from a volcano in the Canary Islands. &#xA0;It&apos;s keeping us warm and fired up. &#xA0;To that end, we&apos;re weaving together our own spatialized metaverse using <em>some </em>of the core architecture innovated at High Fidelity, Inc. </p><p>It is the small mammals that survived the ice age. We&apos;re not a big company by any means, we&apos;re just a plucky little startup who wants a metaverse. We&apos;re haven&apos;t got money to make sexy videos, our shares are currently worth way less than penny stock, we&apos;re not going to have a flashy &quot;initial land offering&quot; on a blockchain. In fact, we&apos;re going to stay away from using the blockchain for now. What we do have is more than enough server resources, donated to us by Amazon, Google and Digital Ocean via the WXR Accelerator and First Republic Bank. &#xA0;What we do have is a groundbreaking open-source metaverse engine, seven years in the making. Most importantly, what we have is an understanding of what needs to be done to get people to actually use it, and perhaps even love it. And as far-fetched as it may sound, we think we&apos;ve got <em>just enough</em> technical skill and moxie to do it. &#xA0;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://tivolicloud.github.io/content/images/2019/11/image-17.png" class="kg-image" alt="Hello!
